# Capstone_3 Proposals


1. Profile Analyzer: using microexpression data from here: https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/node/33019
create a profile image analyzer to classify different expression, then creak a flask app that utilizes the model to classify an image that would be uploaded by the user. I have requested the SPOS, and SRIC database from xiaobai.li@oulu.fi by email. 

2. Liner Remover - part 2 of my capstone 2 project - utilizing supervised learning and auto encoding to try and remove the lines, perhaps build a flask app where user can upload image to have lines removed - dataset procured earlier from Land B.

3. Emoji Recommender - datasets: 
a. Corporate messaging across social platforms from such large companies as: Nestle, Merck, Danone Group, Citigroup, Barclays Bank, Pzfizer, - messages have been categorized as Information, Action, Dialogue by actual people. 
b. emoji_df = data base with emoji name, image, sub_group classification, unicode/codepoints, some other stuff need to look up
