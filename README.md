# Capstone_3 Proposals

.....and the winner is... Line Remover. 



669 unruled boat images
454 with ruled lines

Initial plan (#3 and 4 are stretch goals):

1. create lines on previously unruled images, this will be X (unruled images will be the target)
2. create autoencoder to remove lines
3. test on ruled images, test on images with different kinds of lines
4. create flask app to demonstrate 
5. allow users to upload lined image and have it remove lines?





1. Profile Analyzer: using microexpression data from here: https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/node/33019
create a profile image analyzer to classify different expression, then creak a flask app that utilizes the model to classify an image that would be uploaded by the user. I have requested the SPOS, and SRIC database from xiaobai.li@oulu.fi by email. 

2. Liner Remover - part 2 of my capstone 2 project - utilizing supervised learning and auto encoding to try and remove the lines, perhaps build a flask app where user can upload image to have lines removed - dataset procured earlier from Land B.

3. Emoji Recommender - datasets: 
a. Corporate messaging across social platforms from such large companies as: Nestle, Merck, Danone Group, Citigroup, Barclays Bank, Pzfizer, - messages have been categorized as Information, Action, Dialogue by actual people. 
b. emoji_df = data base with emoji name, image, sub_group classification, unicode/codepoints, some other stuff need to look up
